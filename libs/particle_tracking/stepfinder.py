    """
    Find contiguous True values (plateau) of the boolean array `plateaus`.

    and the second column is the stop index (segments).

    Parameters
    ----------
    plateaus : np.ndarray of type bool
    min_distance_center : int
        Minimum distance, the center of two successive plateaus need to be
        apart from each other. If the distance is shorter, the stop of the
        leading and the start of the following plateau are neglected,
        effectively fusing the two plateaus.
    min_length_high : int
        Minimum number of contiguous True values a plateau has to have to get
        detected as one. If the plateau ist shorter, it is assumed to be no
        plateau and is therefore neglected. The minimum length of the plateaus
        usually is checked, after the distance of the center was checked.
        See parameter `check_center_distance_first`.
    min_length_low : int
        Minimum number of contiguous False values a valley has to have to get
        detected as one. If the valley is shorter, it is assumed to be part of
        a greater plateau, consisting of the preceding plateau, the short
        valley itself, and the succeeding plateau and is therefore neglected.
        The length of valleys is checked after the minimum length of the
        plateaus was checked.
    check_center_distance_first : bool
        Check `min_distance_center` before `min_length_high`.
    fuse : bool
        Fuse plateaus with a too short center distance, or delete the ones
        following the other ones too close.
    validate_truncated : bool, optional
        Validate the length of plateaus starting or stopping at the very first
        [0] or last [-1] index of the plateaus array, i.e. are possibly
        truncated plateaus. If set to True, even these plateaus need to have at
        least `min_length_high` datapoints. If set to False, even truncated -
        and therefore possibly too short - plateaus are detected.

    Returns
    -------
    2D numpy.ndarray of type int
        Segments of plateaus with start indices in the first and stop indices
        in the second column.

    Find steps by comparing variances of forward and backward estimation of

    Implementation of D.A. Smiths Algorithm [1]. Search for maximum is
    performed differently than discribed in this paper:
    Beginning from the left side, all datapoints with y above threshold `y_c`
    are 'collected' bins (segments). Each segment has a start and a stop
    position. A segment is filled, and therefore a new one opened, if either
    the sign of y changed or the length (stop - start) of the segment is more

    switch_accept : bool, optional
        Accept each other following steps, even if the distance `E` would not
        be sufficient, if their direction is opposite from each other.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : 1D numpy.ndarray of type int
        Positions of the steps.
    direction : 1D numpy.ndarray of type bool
        Direction of the steps. True is a positive step, False is a negative
        one.
    step_bounds : 2D numpy.ndarray of type int
        The detected start and stop indices of the steps.
    number : int
        The number of the detected steps.
    plateaus : 2D numpy.ndarray of type int
        The start and stop indices of the plateaus between the steps.
    p_centers : 1D numpy.ndarray of type int
        The indices of the centers of the plateaus.

    Notes
    -----
    For distributions of y which are not steadily growing from left to right
    at some point, total bin widths of at least max_step_width are ensured.
    However be aware that big steps can swallow small steps which are up to
    min_step_size left of it. This can happen only if the y of the big step is
    large compared to the small step, which means, that the center of mass is
    very close to the position of the big step.
    Searching from right to left would preserve a small step on the left, but
    would swallow a small step in distance of about min_step_size on the right.
    If you want to ensure a maximum bin spacing at all costs, search for steps
    in both directions and combine steps you found twice.

    IMPORTANT REMARK:
    The search procedure is performed from the left to the right. There is no
    reason not to do it from the right to the left. Both procedures do
    however yield different results, as the deletion of a step changes the
    step_sizes of the neighbouring steps. Differences in left to right -

    Calculate standard deviation and mean noise of a step.

    Mean noise is the weighted noise noise**2 = sf * f + sb * b. It should be a
    function of the tweezer-force, not peaking at steps.
    Standard deviation is the real standard deviation, which includes steps.
    Averaged over a step-plateau, both values should be equal for perfect
    steps. If a step-plateau contains another step, the s.d. is higher than
    the noise. The ratio noise/s.d. is a qualifier for a step, as good

    Fiter data, find steps and analyse the steps. See notes for further
    explanation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray of type float
        data to be filtered.
    resolution : float
        The resolution of the data in Hz.
    filter_time : float, optional
        The filter time used to filter the data for the edge detector. Set it
        to overwrite the automatically detected optimal filter time. Otherwise,
        the optimal `filter_time` is automatically detected  based on the STD
        of the step_mass from different tested filter_times (see parameters
        `filter_min_t`, `filter_max_t` and `filter_number`)
        You only should set the time manually, if you know that it performs
        well with the given data. A good rule of thumb is to set the
        filter_time to 1/2 the time of the expected minimum dwell time. Higher
        values lead to better averaging, but can miss steps. REMARK: Shorter
        spaced steps can still be found if step direction switches. See also
        the parameter `expected_min_dwell_t`.
    filter_min_t : float, optional
        The shortest time of the window in s with which the datapoints are
        filtered.
    filter_max_t : float, optional
        The longest time of the window in s with which the datapoints are
        filtered. You need to also set `filter_number` to make this parameter
        effective. Defaults to `filter_min_t`.
    filter_number : int, optional
        Number of filters used to determine the optimal filter window length.
        Defaults to 1.
    edginess : float, optional
        The edginess (nonlinearity factor p in Chung1991) of the filtered data.
        The edginess only affects the filtered data, but not the detection of
        the steps itself. An edginess of 0 will smooth out edges, like a simple
        moving mean filter. A higher edginess will preserve edges. A too high
        edginess will cause ripples due to amplification of edges of noise.
        From the paper:
        "Thus, for a faithful preservation of fast signal transient details,
        such as the abrupt changes observed during a single channel
        conductance, a large value of the weighting factor p [...] is
        effective, whereas slow signal variations, e.g., during exponential
        decay back to the baseline, can best be extracted with a smaller p
        value." Chung1991 used values between 1 and 100.
    expected_min_step_size : float, optional
        Low values yield wrong steps. High values yield no steps. Expected
        minimum step size determines the threshold value y_c = 2/3 *
        `expected_min_step_size` / `noise` (see [2]). Defaults to y_c = 2/3.
    expected_min_dwell_t : float, optional
        The minimal dwell time (`step_spacing`), one expects to be existent in
        the data. Used to check the filtered signal for steps. Higher values
        lead to deletion of smaller steps, and each other closly following
        ones, lower values lead to many FPs. Recommended: Set it to None and
        let the algorithm automatically set the min_dwell_t, based on the
        `filter_time`.
    step_size_threshold : str or float, optional
        Minimum step size threshold for the deletion procedure. Following
        values are allowed:
        float: Take the value as a threshold for all steps. Use 0 to turn step
            deletion off: threshold-value = number
            NOT RECOMMENDED for serious analysis
        'static': threshold = y_c / <noise>_data
            Take the same threshold for all steps. Choose static if you want a
            constant threshold for step sizes for all steps.
        'adapt':  Calculate threshold for every step corresponding to y_c and
            noise. threshold(step) = y_c / <noise>_data(step +-
            min_step_spacing). BEST CHOICE: Every found step has the same
            reliability, given by y_c.
    pad_data : bool, optional
        Pad the data to protect the ends from be "eaten up" by the filtering
        process. Defaults to True.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Be verbose. Defaults to True.
    plot : bool, optional
        Plot an overview of the process to find the optimum `filter_time`. And
        additionally return the figure. Defaults to True.

    Returns
    -------
    StepFinderResult : namedtuple
    fig : matplotlib.pyplot.figure
        Only returned, if parameter `plot` is set to True.

    Notes

    Step finder's work-steps
    ========================
    The step_finder has four main work-steps:

    0) Find the optimum `filter_time`, by repeating work-steps 1) - 3) with
    different filter_times and analyse the results.

    1) Filter the data with the forward-backward non-linear filter proposed by
    Chung & Kennedy (1991, J. Neuroscience) [1].

    2) After that it searches for steps by comparing the difference of the
    forward and the backward filter to the noise at the current point. The
    expected_min_step_size (-> threshold y_c) and the expected_min_dwell_t
    (-> min_step_spacing, E in paper) decide wether there is a step or not. See
    Smith (1998, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B) [2].

    3) In the last step, steps are being deleted when they are smaller than a
    minimum allowed step size (see parameter `step_size_threshold` and function
    `get_min_step_sizes()`). This is important, because statistical
    fluctuations can locally look like large steps, even if the plateau behind
    such a step is about the same height as the plateau before.

    Besides these main working steps, information about dwell time and step
    size is being calculated and the significance of a step is determined, e.g.
    if there is a constant slope in the data, the algorithm will find large
    steps.

    Problems:
    =========
    Classification of steps by the parameter m:
    Be aware, that there is always a systematic error coming from the feedback
    of the tweezers or other experimental errors, which the algorithm does not
    consider. The Classification Parameter m, especially the threshold y_c is
    therefore not definitely comparable for all data you analyse.

    Application:
    ============
    See [3].

    Remarks:
    ========
    Regarding the parameters `filter_tmin_t`, `filter_tmax_t` and
    `filter_time`:
    High values smoothen the noise, but probably also diminish the signal. Low
    values leave the signals intact, but probably do not sufficiently reduce
    the noise. Medium values smoothen the noise and leave the signals intact
    and thereby increase the SNR of the data.

    From [1]:
    "The number of predictors [here only 1 forward and 1 backward] and their
    lengths can be varied. Three short pairs of the predictors used to extract
    exponentially decaying signals imbedded in the noise [...] preserved the
    original features of the signal, but the background noise was not
    effectively suppressed [...]. As the predictors of longer lengths were
    added [...], a further reduction in the noise was achieved at the expense
    of distorting the original signal. Although there are a large number of
    possible predictor combinations that can be used for processing a segment
    of data, the choice of the bank of predictors in practice is
    straightforward. Various choices of lengths of predictors should be based
    on the expected durations of signal features. If, for example, we
    anticipate signals of width 10 samples to be present in the data, then
    there should be at least one predictor whose length is less than 10 points
    [here you would set tmin to <= 10]. Naturally, if longer signal features
    are present, then correspondingly longer window predictors should be
    included in the bank.

    Regarding the parameter `expected_min_step_size` (which determines the
    threshold for step detection y_c):
    For perfectly aligned Tweezers m/sqrt(min_step_spacing / 2) is the ttest
    for having NO step. As there are always systematic errors, assume t = m, so
    setting the threshold for step detection y_c to 2 makes the algorithm find
    steps with at least 95 % reliability.
